# CSV Sales Data Viewer

## Overview
This is a single-page web application that fetches sales data from a CSV file and displays the total sales on the page. It uses Bootstrap 5 for styling and Papa Parse for CSV data parsing.

## Setup
1. Ensure that the data.csv file is in the same directory as the index.html file.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.

## Usage
The total sales are automatically calculated and displayed on the page when it loads. If the data.csv file is updated, refresh the page to see the updated total sales.
